# Contributing to our website

## Running the website

1. Clone the repo.
2. Ensure you have Node
3. Build the dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
4. Run the website with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Our Development Process

We try and keep the issues list up to date but to get a better idea of what needs work please talk to us on our [discord](http://discord.codersforcauses.org)

## Testing

When making changes to the code base, make sure that the existing tests pass and you cover
new features appropriately. You can run the test suite

1. `yarn dev` to start the website
2. `yarn cypress:run` on a new terminal to test the website

## Pull Requests

We love to get pull requests so if you see something you can add we will help you integrate it.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs.  When you report an issue the more information the better. Here are some useful things to include:

 * A title as well as a body for the issue
 * A screenshot or video of the problem
 * A snippet of the code in question
 * Place code in blocks so that it reads like code:

    ```
    ```javascript (starting backticks)
    your code here
    ```(terminating backticks)
    ```

## Coding Style

We have eslint and prettier formatting for any code in the repository, if you are using VS Code you can install the official plugins to add automatic code highlighting.

In general, be consistent with existing code.  Look around the codebase and match the style.
