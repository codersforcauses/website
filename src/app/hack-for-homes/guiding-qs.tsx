                <strong>Approach: Open-Ended, Prototype-Driven</strong>
                <p>
                  This hackathon is open-ended, you decide what ‚Äúimproving housing‚Äù means. Your solution could be an
                  app, a platform, a data tool, or even a community initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We encourage prototypes (digital or physical) to showcase your vision. They don‚Äôt need to be perfect,
                  just enough to demonstrate your team‚Äôs ideas in action.
